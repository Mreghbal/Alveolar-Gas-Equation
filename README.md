# Alveolar-Gas-Equation
Python code for the Alveolar Gas Equation in actual conditions.
In this example, the alveolar_gas_equation function takes four arguments: p_b (barometric pressure), p_h2o (water vapor pressure), f_i (fractional concentration of inspired oxygen), and r_q (respiratory quotient). It calculates and returns the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli using the Alveolar Gas Equation formula.

You can input your desired values for the variables barometric_pressure, water_vapor_pressure, fractional_concentration_oxygen, and respiratory_quotient to obtain the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. The result will be printed to the console.
